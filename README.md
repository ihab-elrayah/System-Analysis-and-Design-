CS-255 System Analysis and Design

The DriverPass project aimed to develop a driver training system for Liam's company. The system included features such as online classes, practice tests, appointment scheduling, and driver management, with the goal of providing comprehensive driver education and preparation for driving tests.    

Strong proficiency in creating UML diagrams, including activity, sequence, and class diagrams, which effectively conveyed the system's processes, interactions, and structure. These visual representations significantly enhanced communication within the team and with stakeholders, showcasing adeptness in translating complex concepts into clear and concise diagrams.

I would revise the UML class diagram to ensure an accurate representation of relationships and provide clearer explanations for complex associations, improving overall clarity and understanding for stakeholders.  

Interpreting user needs involved translating their requirements into system design elements based on discussions and interviews. Considering user needs is crucial as it ensures the system aligns with their expectations, enhancing usability and overall satisfaction.    
When designing software, I prioritize understanding requirements and utilize techniques like UML diagrams. Future approaches involve user-centered design, incorporating feedback from discussion, and employing agile methodologies for  development.
